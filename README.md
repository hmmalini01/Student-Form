Project Description – Student Form
- The Student Form Project is a web-based application designed to collect and manage student information in a structured way.
- It allows users to input details such as Name, Age, Gender, Course, and Email, and then displays the submitted data in a dynamic table.
- The project demonstrates essential HTML form handling, CSS styling (with Tailwind for a modern look), and JavaScript DOM manipulation to add, update, and delete records.
- By clicking the Save button, the entered details are appended to the table, making it easy to view and manage multiple student entries.
- This project is a practical exercise in building interactive forms, validating user input, and creating a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow.
- The goal is to provide a clean, user-friendly interface that helps learners understand how front-end technologies work together to manage data effectively.

Would you like me to also write a short README-style version (2–3 lines) that you can directly paste into GitHub or your portfolio?
